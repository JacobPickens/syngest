“Apply these changes to the current canonical repo state. This is a multi-file change requiring a full dump. Output ONLY a downloadable dump.txt (no inline full files). Dump must be lexicographically ordered ---filename--- sections, exclude middleware/fingerer.js, and include a final ---__META__--- JSON footer with version, sha256 of content above footer, and manifest matching the dump entries exactly.”
